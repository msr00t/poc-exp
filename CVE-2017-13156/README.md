Janus CVE-2017-13156 PoC

usage: janus.py dex apk out_apk

Android package installer does NOT check extra data before PKZIP, thus concat DEX+APK together and little bit of fix, installation passed.

ART can run both APK and DEX, so here DEX ahead of base.apk is actually the one to execute.

 * extract the original classes.dex
 * use APKTOOL to do stuffs on it
 * fuse the new dex into original APK
 * update the installed app :)

FAQ:

 * Why my generated apk crashes?

The essential reason is Android still using the original AndroidManifest.xml to parse the app (mainly your new DEX).

So it's good idea to setup a new project with the original AndroidManifest.xml, and fix providers, receivers, exported activities. You don't need to write them well, just auto-generate null dummy classes.
